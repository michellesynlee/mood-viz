      <h1>my 2026 mood tracker</h1>
      <p>
        i have been tracking my mood every day since the start of 2026. 
        i realized that there were patterns in my mood shifts, and i wanted
        to visualize them in a way that was more fun than just words on a notebook. 
        <br><br>
        i have been adding a visualization every month, so check back at the end of each month to see the new visualizations!

  <section class="panel january">
    <div class="text">
      <h2>january</h2>
      <p>i found january to quite literally have the ups and downs of waves, which is what inspired this visualization.
        like clockwork, every 2-4 days i found my mood shifting from a high to a low, and then back up again.
        hover over the dots on the waves to see more detail...
